## TODO / To Investigate

- [ ] Share to twitter functionality - looks like using [twitter cards](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17825195/twitter-share-button-but-with-image) is an option, however may involve server side components.
- [ ] More images, that hopefully don't involve DMCA attempts :cry:
- [ ] Better handling of desktop/mobile and multiple browser implementations/quirks of canvas and image rendering
- [ ] Link/Share URL to direct app injection (if available)
